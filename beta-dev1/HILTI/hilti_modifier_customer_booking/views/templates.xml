											associated or subsidiary companies, as the
											case may be.
										</p>
										<p>"Contract" means the agreement between the Company and the
											Buyer for the purchase of Goods
											from the Company by the Buyer.

											the Buyer for the purchase of
											Goods from the Company by the
											Buyer.

											purchased by the Buyer on the
											terms of this Contract
										</p>

											that policy may be
											updated or revised by Hilti from time to time.
										</p>
										<p>1.2 Unless agreed otherwise in writing between the Company
											and the Buyer, these conditions
											shall be incorporated in all
											Contracts of the Company to sell
											Goods and shall be the sole
											conditions under which the sale takes place. All other terms,
											conditions or other representations,
											whether written or oral,
											are excluded from the Contracts between the
											Buyer and the
											Company,
											including any terms and conditions which the Buyer
											may purport to
											apply under any order for
											Goods.
										</p>
										<p>1.3 These conditions shall prevail unless expressly varied
											in writing and signed by a Director on
											behalf of the Company.
										</p>
										<p>1.4 No statement, description, information, warranty,
											condition or recommendation contained in
											any catalogue, price
											list, advertisement or communication or
											made verbally by any
											of the agents

										<p>1.5 Any written quotation, estimate and/or advertised price

											any order in
											whole or in part for any
											reason, including where the Buyer
											fails the credit approval process

											ordered are not available. Where the Goods ordered are not
											available, the Company will inform the Buyer accordingly and
											may
											recommend a replacement. If the replacement is accepted by
											the Buyer,
											this will constitute a
											binding order for the

											the replacement
											Goods to
											the Buyer.
										</p>
										<h5>2. PRICE</h5>
										<p>2.1 Subject to Clause 2.2 below, the price payable for

											confirmed in writing by Company.
										</p>
										<P>2.2 Unless otherwise agreed in writing between the Company
											and the Buyer, the Company's
											prices may be subject to
											variation to take account of variations in
											wages, materials or
											other costs
											since the date of the Company's quotation or, if
											no quotation is
											issued, the date of the Buyer's
											order. The
											Company accordingly reserves the right to adjust the
											invoice
											price payable by the
											amount of any increase or decrease in
											such costs after the price is
											quoted and the invoice so
											adjusted shall be payable as if it were the original Contract
											price.
										</P>
										<p>2.3 All prices are exclusive of Goods and Services Tax and
											all other applicable taxes, duties and
											other charges. The
											Buyer shall be liable for all and any local
											taxes, duties
											and/or charges as
											appropriate.
										</p>
										<p>2.4 The Buyer agrees that section 32(3) of the Sale of
											Goods Act (Cap. 393) shall not apply to
											Goods sent by the
											Company.
										</p>
										<p>2.5 The Company shall be entitled to invoice the Buyer by
											post or email for the price of the
											Goods in the Singapore
											Dollar or such other currency as the
											Company shall agree in
											writing.
										</p>
										<p>2.6 The Company has the right to invoice the Buyer for the
											costs of any packaging, transportation
											of the Goods or any
											additional costs resulting from any other
											alteration made by
											the Buyer on or
											at the time of delivery or upon notification
											by the Company
											that the Goods are awaiting
											collection. Any such
											additional costs may be invoiced by the Company in
											Singapore
											Dollars or
											such other currency as the Company shall agree in
											writing.
										</p>
										<h5>3. FUEL SURCHARGE/ CARRIAGE AND INSURANCE</h5>
										<p>3.1 The cost of fuel surcharge to the Buyer's premises in
											Singapore shall be in accordance with
											the charges agreed in
											writing between the Buyer and the Company.
										</p>
										<p>3.2 The cost of carriage and insurance of the Goods to the
											Buyer’s premises in Singapore shall be
											in accordance with the
											charges laid out in the Company’s
											prevailing price list on the
											date that the
											order is accepted and confirmed in writing by
											Company
										</p>
										<p>3.3 In all other cases the price of the Goods shall be
											exclusive of carriage and insurance to the
											Buyer's premises.
										</p>
										<p>3.4 Export orders shall be quoted and charged on a FOB
											(port of Singapore) (Incoterms 2010)
											basis.
										</p>
										<h5>4. ADDITIONAL COSTS</h5>
										<p>The Buyer agrees to pay for any loss or extra costs above
											the quoted price for the Goods which
											are directly or
											indirectly incurred by the Company through the
											Buyer's
											instructions or lack of
											instruction or through failure or
											delay in taking delivery or through
											any act or default on the
											part
											of the Buyer, its servants or agents.
										</p>
										<h5>5. TERMS OF PAYMENT</h5>
										<p>5.1 All payments due under any Contract must be made by the
											Buyer within thirty (30) days of
											the date of invoice from
											Company, unless otherwise agreed in
											writing between the Buyer
											and the
											Company. The Buyer shall not be entitled to exercise
											any set off,
											lien or any other similar right or
											claim
										</p>
										<P>5.2 If the Goods are delivered in installments, the Company
											shall be entitled to invoice each
											installment as and when
											delivery thereof has been made and payment shall
											be due in
											accordance
											with Clause 5.1 above in respect of each invoice.
										</P>
										<p>5.3 Any failure by the Buyer to either pay any due
											installment in accordance with this Contract or
											failure to
											give delivery instructions in respect of any Goods shall
											cause the whole of the price for
											Goods already manufactured at
											the time of such a default, to
											become due forthwith without
											any
											notice.
										</p>
										<p>5.4 Prompt payment shall be a condition precedent to future
											deliveries of the Goods due under
											any Contract.
										</p>
										<p>5.5 Without prejudice to any other rights it may have, the
											Company is entitled to charge and to be
											paid interest at 2%
											above the then-current base rate of DBS Bank
											Limited on any
											overdue
											payment of the price of the Goods or the price of any
											installments
											thereof.
										</p>
										<h5>6. DELIVERY</h5>
										<p>6.1 The Company endeavours to deliver the Goods within the
											estimated delivery period specified
											its quotation or otherwise
											specified in writing by Company,
											subject always to the
											availability of
											stock. The estimated delivery period shall be
											calculated from the
											date of the acceptance by the
											Company of
											the Buyer's order, or the date of receipt of all
											necessary
											information to enable the
											Company to manufacture or procure
											the manufacture of the Goods,
											whichever shall be the later.
											If
											no period is stipulated by the Company, then delivery will
											be
											such time after receipt of
											instructions as the Company thinks
											reasonable.
										</p>
										<p>6.2 All times or dates given for delivery of the Goods are
											given in good faith but without any
											responsibility on the part
											of the Company. Time of delivery shall not be of
											the essence
											of any
											Contract nor shall the Company be under any liability
											for any delay
											beyond the Company's
											control
										</p>
										<p>6.3 Where the Goods are handed to a carrier for carriage to
											the Buyer or the Singapore port for
											export, any such carrier
											shall be deemed to be an agent of the
											Company and not of the
											Buyer for
											the purpose of sections 44, 45 and 46 of the Sale of
											Goods Act
											(Cap. 393).
										</p>
										<p>6.4 No liability for non-delivery, loss or damage to the
											Goods occurring post delivery, or for any
											claim that the Goods
											are not in accordance with the Contract, will
											attach to the
											Company, unless
											claims to that effect are notified in writing
											by the Buyer to the
											Company (and in the case of
											claims for
											non-delivery, loss or damage with a copy to the carrier
											if the
											Company's own vehicles
											have not been used to deliver the
											Goods) within 1 day of delivery
										</p>
										<p>6.5 If the Buyer fails to give notice in accordance with
											Clause 6.4 above, the Goods shall be
											deemed to be in all
											respects in accordance with the Contract and
											the Buyer shall
											be deemed to
											have accepted the Goods and shall be bound to pay
											for the same
											accordingly.
										</p>
										<P>6.6 All requests for proof of delivery must be made within
											a period of 21 days following the date
											of the invoice.
										</P>
										<p>6.7 The Buyer agrees that in the event of a valid claim for
											non-delivery, loss or damage to the
											Goods and/or
											non-compliance with the Contract, the Company may at
											its sole
											discretion either
											reprocess or replace the Goods at its own
											expense but shall then be
											under no further liability in
											connection with such non-delivery, loss, damage or
											non-compliance.
										</p>
										<p>6.8 If for any reason the Buyer is unable to accept
											delivery of the Goods at the time when the
											Goods have been
											notified as ready for delivery, the Company may at
											its sole
											discretion, store the
											Goods at the risk of the Buyer and take
											all reasonable steps to
											safeguard and insure them at the
											cost
											of the Buyer, provided that the Buyer shall be immediately
											informed thereof.
										</p>
										<p>6.9 The Company shall have the right to make delivery by
											installments of such quantities of the
											Goods and at such
											intervals as it may decide. Any defect in any
											installment
											shall not be a ground
											for cancellation of the remainder of the
											installments and the
											Buyer shall be bound to accept
											further
											deliveries thereof.
										</p>
										<h5>7. RETURNS AND CANCELLATIONS</h5>
										<p>7.1 For all non-perishable product returns, Hilti must be
											notified within 6 months from delivery.
											All perishable
											products (products with expiry dates) listed in
											Appendix 1 –
											returnable chemical
											products – must be returned within 14 days
											after delivery. Other
											perishable products not listed in
											the
											Appendix 1 are not entitled for return.
										</p>
										<p>Products must be in saleable condition to qualify for
											return. Saleable condition is defined as those
											unused items in
											original packaging, defect-free and in unbroken
											quantities.
											All returns are subject
											to Hilti inspection, testing and
											acceptance. Non-stocking,
											non-standard items and discontinued
											items are not eligible for return credit.
										</p>
										<h5>8. PASSING OF TITLE AND RISK</h5>
										<p>8.1 From the date of delivery to the Buyer, the Goods shall
											be at the risk of the Buyer, who shall
											be solely responsible
											for their custody and maintenance. Unless
											otherwise expressly
											agreed in
											writing, the Goods shall remain the property of the
											Company until all
											payments due to the
											Company from the Buyer
											under the Contract or any other contract have
											been made in
											full
											unconditionally and credited to the Company’s account.
											Whilst the ownership
											of the Company
											continues, the Buyer shall
											keep the Goods separate and identifiable
											from all other goods
											in its
											possession as fiduciary agent and bailee for the
											Company.
										</p>
										<p>8.2 In the event of any resale of the Goods, the beneficial
											entitlement of the Company shall attach
											to the proceeds of the
											sale or other disposition thereof, so
											that such proceeds or
											any claim thereof
											shall be assigned to the Company.
										</p>
										<p>8.3 In the event of failure to pay the price in accordance
											with the Contract, the Company shall
											have the power to re-sell
											the Goods, such power being additional
											to (and not in
											substitution for)
											any other power of sale arising by operation
											of law or
											implication or otherwise and for such
											purpose the
											Company and its servants and agents may forthwith enter
											upon
											any premises or land
											occupied or owned by the Buyer to remove
											the Goods.
										</p>
										<p>8.4 Pending payment of the full purchase price of the
											Goods, the Buyer shall at all times keep the
											Goods
											comprehensively insured against loss or damage by accident,
											fire, theft and other risks
											usually covered by insurance in
											the type of business for which the
											Goods are for the time
											being
											used in an amount at least equal to the balance of the
											price for
											the same time to time remaining
											outstanding. The
											policy shall bear an endorsement recording the Company’s
											interest and shall be
											produced to the Company on request.
										</p>
										<h5>9. WARRANTIES</h5>
										<p>9.1 All Goods are sold with the benefit of and subject to
											the conditions of the warranty supplied
											with them, which is
											available for inspection on request.
										</p>
										<p>9.2 Nothing herein or in any warranty given by the Company
											shall impose any liability upon the
											Company in respect of any
											defect in the Goods arising out of the
											acts, omissions,
											negligence or
											default of the Buyer, its servants and agents
											including without
											limitation any failure by the Buyer
											to comply
											with any recommendations of the Company as to storage
											and
											handling or use or
											servicing of the Goods, use of the Goods
											with other goods or other
											misuse of the Goods or
											accident or
											fair wear and tear of the Goods.
										</p>
										<P>9.3 The Company shall not be liable for any damage, loss,
											costs or expenses of any type
											whatsoever and however arising
											from or in any way connected to or with
											the installation of
											the
											Goods by the Buyer or any of its employees, agents or
											contractors.
											The buyer hereby indemnifies
											the Company against
											all actions, costs, charges, losses, damages
											and expenses
											which the
											Company may incur or sustain by reason of any action
											brought by any
											third party relating in any
											way to the
											installation of the Goods.
										</P>
										<P>9.4 Except as provided for in these conditions, any
											warranties, (whether express or implied by
											statute or common
											law or howsoever), including without limitation
											those of
											satisfactory quality
											or of fitness for a particular purpose
											even if that purpose is
											made known expressly or by
											implication
											of the Company) are hereby excluded. The Company makes no
											representation or
											warranty that the use of the Goods does not
											infringe the intellectual
											property rights or other rights
											of
											any third party and the Company accepts no liability in this
											respect.
										</P>
										<h5>10. BUYER'S RESPONSIBILITY</h5>
										<P>10.1 The selection of the Goods suitable for the Buyer's
											purposes depends on a range of factors.
											These factors include,
											but are not limited to, on-site conditions
											or other
											circumstances of the
											proposed application of the Goods known
											only to the Buyer. The Buyer
											is solely responsible for
											satisfying itself that the data supplied to the Company on
											which
											information or recommendations
											made by the Company are
											based is correct and that any assumptions
											made by the Company
											to
											supplement that data are suitable for the Buyer's purposes.
										</P>
										<P>10.2 The Company accepts no responsibility of any nature
											whatsoever for information or advice
											it supplies, where any
											data supplied by the Buyer is incorrect
											or where any
											assumption which the
											Company has made is unsuitable for the
											Buyer's purposes. The Buyer
											is encouraged to raise with
											the
											Company any questions it may have.
										</P>
										<h5>11. LIABILITY</h5>
										<P>11.1 Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in these
											Terms and Conditions, the Company's
											liability to any user for
											personal injury or death caused by its
											negligence or fraud is
											not limited.
										</P>
										<P>11.2 The Company shall not be liable (whether or not the
											Company has been advised of the
											possibility of such loss) in
											contract, tort, negligence or otherwise
											howsoever arising for
											any
											claim, damage, loss or costs in respect of:
										</P>
										<P>11.2.1 any losses special to the Buyer, any direct loss of
											profits, any direct loss of turnover and/or
											any direct loss of
											revenue; and
										</P>
										<P>11.2.2 any indirect or consequential loss or damage
											howsoever caused including without
											limitation any losses
											special to the Buyer, any loss of profits, loss
											of turnover,
											loss of revenue,
											loss of business and/or loss of data and for
											the avoidance of
											doubt, the sub-clauses in this Clause
											11.2 are
											intended and agreed by the Buyer to be severable.
										</P>
										<P>11.3 Subject to Clause 11.1, the aggregate liability of the
											Company (whether in contract, tort,
											negligence or breach of
											statutory duty or otherwise) to the Buyer for
											any loss or
											damage shall be
											limited to the price of the Goods.
										</P>
										<P>11.4 The Buyer shall be liable for and shall indemnify the
											Company against any and all expenses,
											loss, liability or
											proceedings suffered by a third party arising
											as a result of
											or in connection with
											any act, omission, negligence, and/or
											breach of the terms of
											this Contract or otherwise through
											the
											default of the Buyer.
										</P>
										<h5>12. DEFAULT OR INSOLVENCY OF BUYER</h5>
										<P>12.1 In the event that:</P>
										<p>12.1.1 the Buyer shall be in breach of any of its
											obligations under the Contract;
										</p>
										<p>12.1.2 any distress or execution shall be levied on the
											Buyer's property or assets; or
										</p>
										<p>12.1.3 the Buyer (an individual or partnership) shall make
											or offer to make any voluntary
											arrangement or composition with
											its creditors or become bankrupt or if
											any bankruptcy petition
											be presented against him;
										</p>
										<p>12.1.4 (if the Buyer is a company) the Buyer has an
											administrative receiver or administrator
											appointed or makes a
											voluntary arrangement with its creditors or
											commences to be
											wound up; or
										</p>
										<p>12.1.5 otherwise if the Buyer fails to pays its debts as
											and when they fall due; or
										</p>
										<p>12.1.6 such equivalent event in Clauses 12.1.1 to Clause
											12.1.5 occurs to the Buyer in its local
											jurisdiction;
										</p>
										<p>the Company at its discretion and without prejudice to any
											other right or claim may by notice in
											writing forthwith
											determine wholly or in part any and all of the
											other Contracts
											between the
											Company and the Buyer or may (without prejudice to
											the Company's
											rights subsequently to
											determine the Contract for
											the same cause should it so decide) by
											notice in writing
											suspend
											further deliveries of Goods.
										</p>
										<h5>13. FORCE MAJEURE</h5>
										<p>The Company shall be entitled to delay or cancel delivery
											or to reduce the amount of the Goods
											delivered if it is
											prevented from, hindered or delayed in
											manufacturing,
											obtaining or delivering
											the Goods by normal route or means of
											delivery through any
											circumstances beyond its control
											including, but not limited to, strikes, lock-outs, accidents,
											war,
											fire, reduction in or unavailability
											of power at
											manufacturing plant, breakdown of plant or
											machinery or
											shortage or unavailability
											of raw materials from normal source
											of supply.
										</p>
										<h5>14. WAIVER</h5>
										<p>Any waiver of rights by the Company shall be in writing and
											signed by an authorised
											representative of the Company. The
											waiver by the Company of any right or
											the failure by the
											Company to exercise any right or to insist on the strict
											performance
											of any provision of this
											Contract shall not operate
											as a waiver of, or preclude any further
											exercise or
											enforcement of any
											other right or provision of this Contract.
										</p>
										<h5>15. SEVERABILITY</h5>
										<p>15.1 Each provision of this Contract is severable and
											distinct from the others. The parties intend
											that every such
											provision shall be and remain valid and
											enforceable to the
											fullest extent permitted
											by law. If in any particular case any
											of these conditions shall
											be held to be invalid or shall not
											apply to this Contract, the other conditions shall continue
											in
											full force and effect.
										</p>
										<h5>16. THIRD PARTY RIGHTS</h5>
										<p>A person who is not a party to this Contract has no right
											under the Contracts (Rights of Third
											Parties) Act (Cap. 53B)
											to enforce any term of this Contract but this
											does not affect
											any right or
											remedy of a third party which exists or is
											available apart from
											that Act.
										</p>
										<h5>17. ASSIGNMENT</h5>
										<p>The Buyer may not assign, sub-contract or in any way
